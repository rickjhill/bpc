    <h3>Meet the Board of the BPC</h3>
    <ul>

    <li><strong>President: Barbara Goebel</strong>
    <p>I was introduced to singles pickleball in my 20s, and played some form of doubles on our backyard court in my 40s.  I have only learned to
    play competitive doubles since 2015, along with my husband Ed.  I work part-time as a high school math teacher so I play more in
    the summer.  I've just begun playing at Cornwall.  I'm loving the opportunity to meet more of the pickleball community and privileged
    to be in the midst of all the exciting new developments as president.</p>
    <p>I’m often preparing for a tournament as that is where I most often see my son, Matt, who is a 6.0 player!  In addition to playing doubles, I
    still want to play singles and do drills to improve.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Vice-President: Rick Anderson</strong>
    <p>Throughout my life, I have been very active in a variety of sports including basketball, racketball, softball, soccer, skiing, etc..<p>
    <p>After retirement from teaching I needed to find an activity, besides softball and jogging, to "raise the heart rate" and fill the need for a FUN, social, and yet competitive activity that involved a group of people.  A few individuals were playing pickelball at the Y and the "fun level" was too much to resist. Ok, I became addicted.</p>
    <p>My goal is to out last some of our 80 year-old players and be as good and fun loving as they have been. I love to teach and hopefully I will have the opportunity do so as our facilities and programs grow.</p>
    <p>It has been a pleasure to help facilitate the growth of this sport within the Bellingham community. We appreciate the help received from so many different members that have contributed and we encourage everyone to become involved.</p>
    <p> Remember, "Pickleball is the real dill". Join, enjoy, and volunteer!</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Secretary: Maggi Kriger</strong>
    <p>I started playing pickleball at the YMCA in 2011 following a reduction in my work hours. I love the combination of playfulness, competitiveness, skill development, and community.</p>
    <p>In the end of 2017, Rick Anderson and I got together with a few fellow players to start brainstorming about forming a local pickleball club.
    The momentum carried forward and by the end of June 2018 the (non-profit) Bellingham Pickleball Club was launched.  As a member of the board, I feel blessed to work with such great folks in our community!</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Treasurer: Terri Vossbeck</strong>
    <p>I started playing Pickleball in Spring 2018 and immediately fell in love with the game; what a great way to have
    fun and exercise at the same time. I have especially enjoyed meeting the awesome group of people in the PB community. Since I still work part
    time as a bookkeeper in a dental office, and I watch my granddaughters one day a week, I look forward to new opportunities for weekend and evening play that the BPC is working to
    facilitate. I’m excited to be involved with the Bellingham Pickleball club.</p>
